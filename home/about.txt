Only these directories are useful:
	exc/		# executable files
	excsys/		# executable files for programs
    harbour/    # alright everyone who works with me knows what this means
	note/		# the real ~/Documents directory
	r/			# the real ~/
    sc/         # shortcuts

Any directory else in this $HOME is trash

Note: To use a shortcut, run `$ . shortcut-name`. In mikadb there's a shortcut named 'pp' too!
